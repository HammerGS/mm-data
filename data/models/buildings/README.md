# Modular building kits

Store kits as `<family>/<name>.glb`, for example `fortress_light/fortress_light_a_52.glb`.
Do not nest this catalog under the source tileset's `saxarba` directory. The selected tileset artwork remains
the key for legacy fallback under `models/board/buildings`.

Each file contains one building: an identity `<name>-lod0` group and, normally, optional `<name>-lod1`.
Author no more than two levels for this work; simple kits (especially under 200 triangles) can use just `lod0`.
This is an asset budget: if an existing kit supplies `<name>-lod2`, the loader uses that additional level.
Each group contains mesh nodes ending in `-base#`, `-floor#`, and `-roof#`, with at least one variant of each.
Number variants from 0; sparse numbers are also supported. Roles must match across LODs.
For N levels, the runtime chooses one base, N-1 independently chosen floors (including `floor0`), and one roof.
Choices are stable for each placement; changing height preserves the base, roof, and existing lower floors.

Base and floor meshes are exactly 18 units high in authoring Z-up space. Enterable buildings have hollow walls.
Author all modules and LODs relative to the same XY origin, with LODs superimposed rather than offset sideways.
The loader preserves authored XY coordinates and derives only each module's vertical base from geometry when
assembling one base, N-1 floors and a roof. Modules may be stacked vertically for display; their saved Z placement
is discarded. Asymmetric details do not change a module's horizontal placement. For enterable buildings,
the full roof projection intersected with the selected modules' closed mid-storey wall sections defines generated
interior floors and struts. Keep notches and courtyards in those surfaces.

The four heavy-industrial terrain uses `BoardIndustrial` procedural generator. It assembles
different equipment families with independently chosen heights, distinct domed/conical/flat caps, and pipes
connected to actual neighboring industrial hexes. Industrial height is cover: there are no generated interior
floors, building cutaways, or elevated pointer selections. Ordinary buildings still use the modular contract above.

The active industrial materials live in `models/board/textures/industrial/paint.png` and `steel.png`.
The shared `fan.png` is an opaque 128x128 texture on a static quad, with mipmaps and no animation.
`tools/buildings/heavy-industrial/` preserves the first prototypes but are superseded by the runtime generator.
